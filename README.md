# NFT Marketplace DApp #

This NFT Marketplace is built using a technology stack that includes Solidity for writing smart contracts, React for the frontend, and Ethers for blockchain interaction. To set up, first, ensure Node.js (version below 16.5.0) and Hardhat are installed. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the local blockchain with Hardhat. After connecting your Metamask wallet, deploy the smart contracts and run tests.
